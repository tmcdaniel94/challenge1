# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to put into practice the HTML, CSS, Git and Github skills introduced in module one of UT's bootcamp. Some of those skills included using semantic elements, linking local files and images to webpages, deploying webpages, and applying design through CSS, including the box model and positioning. One challenge I faced during this project was simplifying the code to accomplish a goal. More than once, I realized that what I was trying to do could be achieved in many fewer steps that I originally thought, often by using elements or attributes that already existed within the code.
